# BART Departures

The BART website is annoying, and makes me click many times to find the information I want.

This website displays the departure and arrival times to and from Berkeley/Montgomery Street station by querying the BART API.

In the future, it'd probably be nice to support customizable destinations through a dropdown.
For now, though, if you are so inclined, you could simply change the parameters called in the function to change the to/from destinations.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add customizable to/from locations, probably through a dropdown.
- [ ] Figure out how to do nice loading boxes, instead of just having them be blank
- [ ] Improve the aesthetic
- [ ] profit??
